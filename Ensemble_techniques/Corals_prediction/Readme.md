# Machine Learning for Coral Bleaching Prediction

This project focuses on predicting **coral bleaching** using machine learning models. It analyzes key oceanographic parameters such as **Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies (SSTA), ClimSST, Depth, Longitude, and Latitude** to determine their correlation with bleaching events.

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including correlation heatmaps
- Machine learning models for bleaching prediction
- Model evaluation and visualization

## 🛠 Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```
##  📊 Data Analysis

The project includes data visualizations such as:

- 📈 Correlation heatmaps  
- 🔍 Feature importance graphs  
- 📊 Model performance evaluation  

## 📈 Results

The models are evaluated based on:

- ✅ MSE
- 📌 RMSE
