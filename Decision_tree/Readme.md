## DECISION TREE
A decision tree is one of the most powerful tools of supervised learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. It builds a flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label.
