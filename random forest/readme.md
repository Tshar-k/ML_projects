# Random Forest 
A random forest is an ensemble learning method used for classification and regression tasks in machine learning. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode (in classification) or mean prediction (in regression) of the individual trees.
This project also includes **Pipelining** of an ML model. This also encludes **Hyperparameter tunning**
